# PromptForge  
### *Bridging the Gap in Prompt Engineering with AI-Powered Precision*

PromptForge is a full-stack application designed to **simplify and elevate prompt engineering** — enabling users to craft high-quality, structured, and model-specific prompts effortlessly.  
The system empowers anyone — from beginners to advanced AI developers — to generate refined prompts for **models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Groq** with just a few clicks.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

The core goal of **PromptForge** is to **reduce the gap in prompt engineering** by making it easier for users to create **advanced, structured prompts** for complex AI tasks — including:

- 🎬 **JSON prompts for video generation models** (with details like camera angles, duration, lighting, etc.)  
- 🧩 **System prompts** for defining model behaviors and context  
- 💬 **Regular creative or analytical prompts** for general LLM interactions  

This project leverages the **Groq API** for **fast and efficient LLM inference**, delivering results with minimal latency while maintaining exceptional prompt quality.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/PromptForge.git
cd PromptForge
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a .env file with
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Run the backend
```bash
python app.py
```

Run the frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧩 System Prompt Design Philosophy

# The backend uses an advanced system prompt architecture that ensures:

- Contextually aware, structured prompt formatting.

- Auto-detection of key elements (e.g., duration, lighting, perspective).

- Adaptability for different model types and content generation tasks.

# These system prompts are capable of handling:

- Video generation models

- Audio synthesis prompts

- Story generation with scene breakdowns

- JSON schema-based outputs for agents

##🧪 Future Improvements

 - Integration with OpenAI and Anthropic APIs

 - Dark mode toggle in frontend

 - RAG-based context retrieval for data-grounded prompt generation

 - Export prompts as .json, .txt, or .yaml

 - Prompt history and version comparison
